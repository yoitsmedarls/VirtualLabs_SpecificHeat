/**
 * EXPERIMENT PROCEDURE
 *  1. Measure the mass of the Aluminum bar and the calorimeter (without water).
 *  2. Fill the calorimeter with approximately 1/4 amount of tap water and
 *     measure the initial temperature.
 *  3. Measure the mass of 1/4 amount of tap water by subtracting the mass of
 *     the empty calorimeter from the mass of the calorimeter + 1/4 amount
 *     of water.
 *  4. Tie a string on the body of the Aluminum bar. See the figure below.
 *  5. Using a hotplate or water heater, boil at least 100 mL of water in the
 *     100 mL beaker.
 *  6. While boiling, submerge the Aluminum bar into the boiling water
 *     (attached a string to the Al bar), and wait until the object‚Äôs
 *     temperature is 90 C.
 *  7. After this, measure the temperature of the boiling water. Label this as
 *     the initial temperature of the metal.
 *  8. Very quickly transfer the metal from the boiling water into the
 *     calorimeter with tap water. Put a cover on the calorimeter to avoid
 *     heat transfer.
 *  9. Put a thermometer inside the calorimeter. Wait until the system reaches
 *     thermal equilibrium (The reading in the thermometer is now constant).
 *     After that, measure the final temperature of the system ùëáùëì.
 * 10. Repeat procedures 1 to 9, this time use a large metal ball.

 * EXPERIMENT FLOW
 *  - User selects from two options, GUIDED or UNGUIDED mode.
 *
 *    GUIDED MODE
 *     - Laboratory simulation with visual guides, tooltips, and walkthroughs
 *       for the entirety of the specific heat experiment
 *     - A text prompt will show the details of the experiment, such as the
 *       experiment description, objectives, materials needed, and expected
 *       result from the experiment.
 *     - User will have access to the materials needed in the simulation, as
 *       well as a notepad for recording
