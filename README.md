## About the Paper

**Title:** Designing an Interactive Laboratory Simulation Software for Specific Heat Experiments Using C++

**Abstract:**

C++ is widely known for its speed and memory efficiency, which is why it is commonly used to create programs for scientific computing, game development, multimedia editing, or simply any application that demands such high performance and efficiency. Such a programming language enables programmers to create programs that are beneficial for a wide range of audiences and use cases, which for this paperâ€™s topic, is for educational purposes.
As such, this study focuses on developing an online laboratory simulation software for specific heat experiments using C++, allowing students to conduct such experiments and gain insight from them at their own time and convenience. To enhance the learning experience, visualization features have been used, such as SFML, which is a simple, fast, cross-platform, and object-oriented multimedia API for C++.
The laboratory simulation software provides useful tools for conducting specific heat experiments and testing whether theoretical concepts match with what happens in real-life. In particular, the software allows the students to measure the specific heat of various solids with a virtual calorimetry setup. Data collection, calculation, and comparison tools are also available for the students to utilize so that they can get a better understanding of specific heat capacities of various solids in the virtual laboratory. Furthermore, guided and exploratory modes are also designed to provide appropriate experiences both to those that are familiar or unfamiliar to the experiment process.
Having such software readily available for students to use is crucial for a more holistic learning experience, especially for topics such as specific heat, where interaction is where most of the learnings come from. Students, through this software, will be able to conduct virtual experiments of specific heat whenever they want, and they can try every possible scenario that they can think of in order to confirm what they have learned in their lecture classes.
Apart from student benefits, professors and laboratory instructors will significantly benefit from such simulation software, as they will have another tool to teach specific heat to the students. This is on top of the fact that such software can be used without needing to go to a physical laboratory, drastically increasing the availability and accessibility of such experiments.
